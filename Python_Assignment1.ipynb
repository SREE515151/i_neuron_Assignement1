Strings in Python are immutable. \n\nVariable:\nVariables are used to store and manipulate data in a program. variables are named storage location that holds a value. These are used to store and refer to different types of data, including strings, numbers, boolean values etc. Python does not require explicit declaration of variables.\n\nIn short, a string is a specific type of data, while a variable is a container that can hold different types of data, including strings.

Integers can be used for mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\nString (str):\nString represents a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks (single or double). Example: \"Hello, World!\" and 'ineuron' are strings. Strings in Python are immutable. Various operations on strings like concatenation, slicing and length retrieval can be performed.\n\nList (list):\nList represents an ordered collection of elements enclosed in square brackets ([]). For example, [4, 7, 2, 9] is a list. Lists can store elements of different data types, and they are mutable, which means one can modify the elements of a list. Elements in a list can be accessed using their index values, and you can perform operations like appending, removing, sorting, and slicing on lists.",
